# Movie-Recommendation
This application allows users to filter through a database of movies, and get back a list of movie recommendations that align with their interests To create this application, first, we needed to decide which categories the user would be able to filter the available movies with. We settled on allowing the user to pick the minimum rating their movies have to reach, the decade(s) they were from, the genre(s) they were linked with, the minimum and maximum length the movies should be, and the language(s) the movies should be filmed in. With these categories in mind, we also allowed users to opt out of filtering via a certain category, which would in turn set those filters to all the available options in the database. Once the user gets through all the questions, a list will be printed out offering them some movies that adhere to their current interests! We also decided to implement some data analysis by creating a method that would return the most prevalent genres within the decade of their choosing, thus allowing the user to receive recommendations in regard to what genre had the most movies.
